    A functionally reactive game engine, with headgear to protect you
    from the headache of game development provided. Inspired by <a href="//elm-lang.org">Elm</a>.

  <h3>Simple</h3>
  <p>
    Helm's API provides a simplistic and elegant way to make games.
    Besides a straight forward vector-graphics based drawing API,
    there's the obvious things like keyboard, mouse, joystick and framerate handling,
    but also higher-level concepts like automatons.

<div class="one-third column">
  <h3>Dynamic</h3>
  <p>
    In Helm, input events like key presses and mouse clicks
    are accessed through a concept called signals &mdash; essentially
    values that change over time. This allows you to write
    logic dependent on input events like window resizes
    dynamically, without having to go to the extra effort
    to write callbacks that listen to events like in a regular
    game engine.
  </p>

<div class="one-third column">
  <h3>Powerful</h3>
  <p>
    Built on the <a href="//hackage.haskell.org/package/elerea">Elerea FRP framework</a> in
    <a href="//haskell.org">Haskell</a>, Helm aims to be simplistic by default but
    support complex behaviour when needed. To do this, Helm provides things like an implementation of
    piped-based signals called <em>automatons</em> that allow you to compose the concept of signals
    to do factory-like logic, i.e. operations that take an input and output something valuable.

  <h3>Get Started</h3>
  <p>
    Install the <a href="//haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a> and then
    <a href="/guide/installing">install Helm using the Cabal build system</a>. Here's some example code to give you
    an idea of how to work with the API. It samples the window dimensions signal
    at every render, using the sampled values to render a red square with a side length of
    <em>64</em> at <em>(100, 100)</em>.
